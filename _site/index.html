            <h2>DO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES?</h2>
            <p>
            <h3>The plot</h3>
            <p>
            VestaTech a fictitious Luxembourgish start-up is in an arms race with a large international conglomerate to reach for and exploit the resources of a close by asteroid.
            </p>
            Join us in this imaginative adventure where not everyone will play fair.
            <p>
            Who knew that the last frontier in space would be digital?
            </p><p>
            <b>Soon, you'll be able to show us what you really got!</b></p>
            
            <h3>How will the challenge be delivered?</h3>
               <p> Participants aged 13 to 25 years old are invited to register via our <a href="https://vestatech.cybersecuritychallenge.lu">dedicated web site</a>. PLease note that a valid email will be required for the registration to be validated. Once registered, the participants will have access to a specific personal zone where they will be able to interract and play the game by initially submitting "flags", i.e. sets of characters that if valid will grant them points, i.e. VestaCoins.</p>
               <p>The challenge as such will be divided in 3 main chapters, running from december 2018 to May 2019. On december the 1rst, we will announce the first chapter. However, participants are invited to keep their eyes open... some flags mights already be available starting from now.</p>
               <p>We will promote the challenge within Luxembourg schools and training institutions relying on our partners. Our goal is both to raise awarness on IT security issues and mean of tackling them, and to promote this field of study within the general interrested population.</p>
               
               <h3>This is for IT experts only, right?</h3>
               <p>Actually <b>no</b>. Some challenges will clearly require IT skills. But in line with the ENISA European Cyber Security Challenge, we believe that IT security can only be tackled by employing complementary skills. Soon, challenges focused on communication and business will arise, as the crisis will be transversal within our fictionnal company.</p>
               
               <h3>VestaCoins?</h3>
               <p>We have invented a fake crypto-currency, that will play a major role in our story. It does not and never will have a real market value, but only be used as a score counter. And yes, just like in real life, the value might get volatile.... who knows.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the Cybersecurity Challenge Luxembourg?</h3>
            
            <p>The Cybersecurity Challenge Luxembourg is organized by C3, the Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg, within the frame of the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) which is an initiative by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).</p>
            
            <p>This competition targets open-minded creative digital natives. Our aim is not only to find talents but encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity and related disciplines.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, through CSCL, we promote safe online behaviors by raising awareness on information security issues as well as develop expertise and interest in cybersecurity through challenging games and skill tests.</p>
