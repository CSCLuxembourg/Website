# CSCL.LU

The Cybersecurity Challenge Luxembourg is organized by C3, the Cybersecurity Competence Center Luxembourg, a department of SECIURITYMADEIN.LU, within the frame of the European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC) which is an initiative by the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA).

This competition targets open-minded creative digital natives. Our aim is not only to find talents but encourage young people to pursue a career in cybersecurity and related disciplines.

Furthermore, through CSCL, we promote safe online behaviors by raising awareness on information security issues as well as develop expertise and interest in cybersecurity through challenging games and skill tests.

_Note: There are NO challenges in this source code._ Seriously.
