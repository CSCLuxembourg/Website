<H4>Fact #1: the subject of online private life does not excite the crowds.</H4>

<H4>Fact #2: computer & network security is complex.</H4>

<H4>Fact #3: Most events on this topic are deadly boring.</H4>
<div class="image"><img src="images/affiche-rotondes.png" alt="" style="float:right;width:290px;height:485px;" />
<p>And yet ... Imagine a cycle of conferences about the security of the connected citizen. Imagine a form adapted to the time of the aperitif, where the public would attend as much to relax as to learn. Let's imagine events focusing on a different practical topic related to our online private lives each time. The Cloud, Internet of Things, data leaks etc. affect us all.</p>

<p>In collaboration with Rotondes we created such a series of events last year and amazingly enough we have been invited back for a 2nd season!</p>

<p>Once again we will be dealing with the most up to date topics of our time and the speakers will have a specific objective: to make the subject digestible. And they will have a method - humor.</p>

<p>Your host Matthieu Farcot, manager of several awareness activities (including hack4kids.lu) as well as lesser interesting stuff such as legal affairs at securitymadein.lu, along with a range of guest experts, will aim to keep the knowledge flowing and the humour rollin', so get comfortable, order a drink and enjoy the ride at Crypto Apero Season 2 - it'll be even better than Netflix & Chill.</p>

<p><i>Seriously.</i></p>
